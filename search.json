    "title": "Analyzing social scientists’ testimonies trends before the United States Congress from 1946 to 2016",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, I analyze the frequency and causes of social scientists’ appearance before the United States Congress from the years 1946 to 2016 along with other factors. The majority of the Congressional representatives come from a political background, but often legislation that they pass has many social and economic consequences especially taking to account that Congress has the power of the purse. Thus, it would make sense for Congress to rely more on experts for making laws. Especially to question people that hold positions in the federal reserve or treasury about the state of the economy and what their organization is doing. It would only make sense to expect the number of such testimonies to increase over time as we have become more science and data-driven society with more complex societal problems. But in this project, I show as we analyze the data that Congress doesn’t rely more on the help of experts per se, but only in times of crisis. Additionally, it seems the majority of testimonies are being done by economists which are expected by taking to account the nature of Congress’s responsibilities. As we analyze the reasons and committees that scientists most often testify we see the majority of Congressional concerns are toward’s budget, taxes, health care, employment, social security, education, China, and small businesses,… which are mostly economic-related matters. It also seems a democratic-leaning Congress slightly increases the number of testimonies by social scientists. For this project I used a variety of charts such as bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and line plots along with Network and Text analysis and BeautifulSoup for web scrapping the data.\n\n\n\n    This project explores uses three different datasets. The main dataset is the social scientists who testified before Congress from 1946-2016(with a slight update from 2016), the hearings they testified at, and the characteristics of those hearings, such as the congressional committees that convened them. This dataset was collected with the support NSF grant by Charles Seguin, Thomas V. Maher, and Yongjun Zhang and published on July 19, 2022.      I couldn’t find a dataset that has a breakdown of each Congress by party and year. But I found a table containing this information on the History, Art & Archives of the US House of Representatives. So I scrapped the website with BeautifulSoup API, turned it into a data frame with Pandas, and saved it as CSV.      To find if there is a correlation between crises and scientists’ testimonies, I decided to look at the recession data as it is the biggest economic challenge for Congress. Federal Reserve publishes all of its economic data, and the Federal Reserve Bank Of St. Louis had recession data from 1967 to now, which I used for this project.\n\n\n\n\nSocial scientists congressional testimony.\nParty Divisions of the House of Representatives, 1789 to Present.\nDates of U.S. recessions as inferred by GDP-based recession indicator\n\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of Covid-19, science and scientists have faced a lot of distrust and attacks from the public and even Congress. I was curious to see if Congress has historically relied on the experience and guidance of experts for help or not. Specifically, during times of crises like the financial crises of 2008 or the stagflation era of the 1980s, the 2001 terrorist attack, and the tech bubble of 2001. I also wanted to see whether our government relies more on the help of experts compared to the past as we have progressed and have more experts available to help us in making legislation. I also wanted to study the effect of political parties on how it affects the view on science and scientists testimonies.\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of social scientists does Congress mostly invite to testify?\nHas the number of social scientists appearing before Congress increased over time?\nDoes Congress being dominated by Republicans or Democrats affect the number of social scientists testifying?\nAre there any trends in the subfields of social scientists who testify?\nWhat type of social scientists testify the most, and what are the probable causes?\nFor what causes does Congress mostly invite social scientists to testify?\nAre there any patterns between crises and the number of scientists testifying before Congress?\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nRequirement already
